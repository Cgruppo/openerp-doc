菜单组织规则
========================

.. i18n: All menus have to be suited to one business application. Each user must see all menus linked to their job. They should perform their workload in one menu only. This is the goal of all the applications. The user should be able to navigate through all his workflow from a single menu to make his work easier, faster and user friendly.
..

菜单应该适应一个业务应用。每个用户应该都能看到他所需要的菜单。用户应该可以只用在一个菜单中完成他们的工作。这也是所有业务应用的目标。用户应该能够在一个菜单中完成他所有的工作流程，使他的工作变得更容易，更快速和更友好的导航。

.. i18n: Menus are defined in a certain way to make the work of users easier . So, users can see all the menus they need in a logical order, to facilitate navigation and use. A salesman doesn't need to see the invoices before he has even made the quotation. 
..

菜单应该定义为某种方式，让用户的工作更加容易。因此，用户应该看到按照逻辑顺序排列的所有菜单，以方便导航和使用。如一位销售代表在作出报价之前，并不需要看到发票。

.. i18n: Main menus are also organized to facilitate the work of a manager. Indeed, in an SME, a manager needs access to many applications: Sales, Projects, Human Resources, Marketing and Accounting. When he opens his instance of OpenERP, he has to see main menus in a logical order. 
..

主菜单的组织同样也是为了方便经理工作。实际上在中小企业中，经理往往需要访问许多应用：销售、项目管理、人力资源、市场营销和财务。当他打开 OpenERP 之后，他应该看到井井有条的菜单。
