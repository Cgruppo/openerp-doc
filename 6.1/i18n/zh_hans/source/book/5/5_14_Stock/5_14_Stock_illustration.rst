.. i18n: Understanding Double-Entry Stock Management

..

理解复式库存管理
===========================================

.. i18n: To illustrate this concept of stock management, see how stock moves are generated by the following
.. i18n: operations:
..

本章节用于解释库存管理（或存货管理，stock management）的概念，看一下以下操作是怎样产生库存异动的：

.. i18n: * Receiving products from a supplier,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * Delivery to a customer,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * Inventory operation for lost materials,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * Manufacturing.
..

* 从供应商处接收产品，

* 发货至客户

* 丢失物料(or 损耗物料？lost materials)的库存操作

* 生产

The structure of stock locations is shown by the figure :ref:`fig-stloctree`. Stocks are assumed to be totally
empty and no operation is in progress nor planned.

.. i18n: If you order '30 bicycles' from a supplier, OpenERP will do the following operations on receipt of the products:

如果你从供应商处订购 '30台单车'，OpenERP会在接收时候执行以下操作：

.. i18n: If you deliver 2 bicycles to a European customer, you will get the following transactions for the

.. i18n: So you can see that the sum of the stocks of a product in all the locations in OpenERP is always
.. i18n: zero. In accounting you would say that the sum of the debits is equal to the sum of the credits.
..

所以你能看到，在OpenERP中，一个物料在所有库位的库存总和为0
类似的，在会计中，你会有借方总和等于贷方总和
（注：感觉是说OpenERP中的事务记录设计是参考会计里面的借贷设计）

.. i18n: Partner locations (customers and suppliers) are not located under your company in the hierarchical
.. i18n: structure, so their contents are not considered as part of your own stock. So if you just look at
.. i18n: the physical locations inside your own company, those two bicycles are no longer in your company.
.. i18n: Although they are no longer in your own physical stock, it is still very useful to see them in your customer's
.. i18n: stock, because that will help when you carry out detailed stock management analysis.

Partner locations (customers and suppliers) ，are not located under your company in the hierarchical
structure, so their contents are not considered as part of your own stock. So if you just look at
the physical locations inside your own company, those two bicycles are no longer in your company.
Although they are no longer in your own physical stock, it is still very useful to see them in your customer's
stock, because that will help when you carry out detailed stock management analysis.
注：直翻有点拗口，上面的意思是：
OpenERP中，伙伴库位（partner locations）的库存并不属于你的公司，所以他们的库存量不属于你。
物理库位(physical locations)才是属于你的公司的，你只需要查看physical locations来了解自己的现有量状况。
参考上面的例子，已经发走的2台自行车不在属于你的公司
虽然他们不属于你公司的物理库存了，但是这笔数据放置在你的客户库存里面还是很有用的，这样可以帮助你进行更为详细的库存分析。

     In managing stock, a gap between the data in the software and real quantities in stock is
     difficult to avoid.
     Double-entry stock management gives twice as many opportunities to find an error.
     If you forget two items of stock, this error will automatically be reflected in the
     counterpart's location.

.. i18n: You can make a comparison with accounting, where you will easily find an error because you can look
.. i18n: for an anomaly in an account or in the counterparts: if there is not enough in a bank account then that is
.. i18n: probably because someone has forgotten to enter a customer's invoice payment. You always know that the
.. i18n: sum of debits must equal the sum of the credits in both accounting and OpenERP's stock management.
