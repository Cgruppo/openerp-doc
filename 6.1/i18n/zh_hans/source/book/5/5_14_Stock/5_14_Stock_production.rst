It is better to encode a procurement order rather than direct purchasing or production. This method
has the following advantages:

.. i18n: * The form is simpler because OpenERP calculates the different values from other values and defined rules: purchase date calculated from order date, default supplier, raw materials needs, selection of the most suitable bill of materials, etc.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * The calculation of requirements prioritises the procurements. If you encode a purchase directly, you short-circuit the planning of different procurements.
