Managing Attachments
====================

.. i18n: As you see, you can connect any directory in the document management system to an OpenERP
.. i18n: resource. The system then manages its creation and keeps the directory synchronized with the

.. i18n: directories because OpenERP does all this automatically as it resynchronizes with its own database.

As you see, you can connect any directory in the document management system to an OpenERP
resource. The system then manages its creation and keeps the directory synchronized with the
reports generated by OpenERP from its own data. You do not have to create or rename these
directories because OpenERP does all this automatically as it resynchronizes with its own database.

.. i18n: You can then copy the files in the directories that correspond to any of the resources. The files
.. i18n: are automatically attached to OpenERP's documents through attachment management. Conversely, if you
.. i18n: attach a document to one of OpenERP's resources then that document will automatically become visible
.. i18n: over FTP in the document management system.

You can then copy the files in the directories that correspond to any of the resources. The files
are automatically attached to OpenERP's documents through attachment management. Conversely, if you
attach a document to one of OpenERP's resources then that document will automatically become visible
over FTP in the document management system.

.. i18n: .. note::  File Storage
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:    If you do not install the document management system then the files that are attached to an OpenERP
.. i18n:    resource are stored directly in the database.
.. i18n:    Once the document management system has been installed,
.. i18n:    the contents of the files are no longer stored in the database but are stored instead on the OpenERP
.. i18n:    server filesystem in a directory named 'filestore'.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:    You can then read and add attachments to OpenERP resources quite independent of the OpenERP
.. i18n:    interface or the FTP server using simple drag and drop.

.. note::  File Storage

   If you do not install the document management system then the files that are attached to an OpenERP
   resource are stored directly in the database.
   Once the document management system has been installed,
   the contents of the files are no longer stored in the database but are stored instead on the OpenERP
   server filesystem in a directory named 'filestore'.

   You can then read and add attachments to OpenERP resources quite independent of the OpenERP
   interface or the FTP server using simple drag and drop.
