.. i18n: Classic Document Management Solutions

传统的文档管理方案
=====================================

.. i18n: Faced with the need to organize documents, companies have looked at a number of document management
.. i18n: solutions that are promoted today, from simple email archiving to complete electronic management
.. i18n: systems dedicated to arbitrary documents.
..

面对需要整理的文件，企业一直在寻找文档管理的解决方案，从简单的邮件归档发展成完整的电子文档管理系统。

.. i18n: Unfortunately, these solutions have not always been very useful because they are too little integrated
.. i18n: in companies' management systems. Most solutions that we have come across, are underused by the
.. i18n: employees – often used by some of them but not by all.
..

不幸的是大多数解决方案并不是非常实用，因为他们与公司的管理系统集成度太低。我遇到的大多数解决方案的结果是
只有少部分人使用系统，而不是全部人。

.. i18n: The primary reason for this is that a document management system that is not integrated imposes extra
.. i18n: work on an employee. For example, a salesperson should ideally save each customer confirmation in the
.. i18n: document management system. Only that means quite a heavy additional workload just for an order
.. i18n: confirmation:
..

这其中最主要的原因是一个文档管理系统没有把雇员额外的工作也集成了。
例如：销售人员最好可以将客户每次的确认都存档到系统里面，这意味着仅仅为这些确认就多了
相当沉重的额外工作量：

.. i18n: #. Receive and read the email from the customer,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: #. Save the email and its attachments on the desktop,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: #. Connect to the ERP system and confirm the order,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: #. Connect to the document management system,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: #. Look for the best place to store the document,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: #. Create a directory for the customer and the order if it does not yet exist,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: #. Copy the files from the desktop to the right place in the document management system.
..

#. 查收/查阅来自客户的邮件，

#. 桌面操作发送邮件及邮件附件，

#. 直接连接ERP系统进行单据流程管理，

#. 连接文档管理系统，

#. 优化文档存储位置，

#. 如果订单不存在就为客户创建一个目录，

#. Copy the files from the desktop to the right place in the document management system.

.. i18n: This is obviously a lot of operations just to handle a simple order confirmation. You can understand
.. i18n: why many companies hardly use their document management system even if they have gone to the cost and
.. i18n: effort of purchasing and installing one.

.. i18n: It is very difficult to keep information in the company's management system synchronized
.. i18n: with that in the document management system. For example, when a customer changes his address, users
.. i18n: will modify the details in the management software, but usually, not in the document management
.. i18n: system.

will modify the details in the management software, but usually, not in the document management
system.

.. i18n: Furthermore, since users should create the same storage structure in both systems, you quickly find
.. i18n: after only a few months that the information in the document management system is quite disconnected
.. i18n: from that in the company's management system, if the two are separate. For example, how do you know
.. i18n: where to store your least-frequently used documents such as (perhaps) employee car-leasing
.. i18n: documents?

.. i18n: Also, document management systems are typically very complex because they must manage user access
.. i18n: rights in just the same way as those that are available in the company management system. This means
.. i18n: that you have to enter the same sort of data about access rights twice for the system
.. i18n: administrators.
