.. i18n: The Importance of Good Document Management

良好的文档管理系统的重要性
===============================

.. i18n: Globalization means that workplaces are ever more geographically dispersed. This means that
.. i18n: documents are also used more than ever by people in several
.. i18n: countries and continents for communicating and collaborating.
..

全球化意味着工作地点更分散。这意味着文件的使用在国家与大洲之间的沟通和协作中更加频繁。

.. i18n: You will see communication problems even between employees in the same office because they do not have
.. i18n: easy access to the documents that they need. You find some documents kept by someone in the accounts
.. i18n: office, shared directories that serve everybody, some documents in paper form, others in electronic
.. i18n: form – quite a free-for-all.
..

你会看到即使在同一个办公室的雇员之间沟通都是有问题的，因为他们不容易获得他们所需要的文件。
你发现有些文件是存放在在财务办公室。有些是作为每个人都可以访问的共享目录，有些文件是纸质，有些是电子文档。

.. i18n: An explosion in the number of documents that a company needs does not help. If their storage and
.. i18n: indexation are badly organized, these documents become useless because they are almost impossible to
.. i18n: find.
..

通过增加文件数量是解决不了这些问题的。如果文件的存档和索引组织得不好，这些文件就会变得毫无作用，因为他们是如此难以检索。

.. i18n: The results of poor document management can lead to a significant loss of time. Ask yourself how
.. i18n: often you find yourself looking for:
..

文件管理不善的结果可能导致耗费大量的时间。问问自己，用了多久你才找到以下你所需要的文件：

.. i18n: * A supplier catalogue that has been sent to a purchasing manager,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * A customer contract signed several months ago,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * The final set of Terms and Conditions offered to a specific customer,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * The documents required for employing a new member of staff,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * An order confirmation sent by a customer to one of your salespeople or, perhaps even more common,
.. i18n:   when the relevant salesperson has gone on vacation, if you ever received such an order confirmation,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * A procedure from your quality manual if there has been a process fault,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * An email which was sent to one of your colleagues,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * A document that you need to be a template for a specific type of contract,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * A complete history of communications between yourselves and a supplier about a given contract.
..

* 一份已经发送给采购经理的供应商目录，

* 一位客户几个月前签订的合同，

* 提供给某个客户的条款和细则最终本，

* 对于雇佣新员工的要求细则的文档，

* 由客户发送到销售人员的已确认的订单，甚至更为常见的：你收到订单确认但是相关的销售人员去度假了，

* 一本你的有某个工序出错了的质量手册，

* 一封已经发送你同事的电子邮件，

* 一个你需要的特定类型的合同样本，

* 一份关于合同上的供应商的完整通信历史。

.. i18n: Even worse than the loss of time, perhaps, the lack of good document management is bad for the
.. i18n: quality of your organization and the service provided by your company. In such a company it is likely
.. i18n: that:
..

比浪费时间更糟的是缺乏良好的文档管理，这可能影响您公司的组织以及提供服务的质量。在这样的公司通常是：

.. i18n: * sets of documents do not follow a standard layout,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * all the salespeople prepare quotations in their own way and gradually change the way they do it
.. i18n:   for themselves but not for the group,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * a correction to a type of contract stays with a small group of people and does not percolate back
.. i18n:   into the rest of the company to benefit other users,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * version management is chaotic or even non-existent.
..

* 文件归类没有遵循一套标准,

* 每个销售人员都用自己的格式来组织报价单并且所有更改的都只对个人而不是以组为单位,

* 某部分人在纠正合同的内容，但没有传达到公司的其他人使他们受益,

* 版本管理混乱，甚至没有。

.. i18n: So a good integrated document management system can be a powerful tool to help in day-to-day company
.. i18n: management. With it you could also easily:
..

良好的综合文档管理系统是有助于公司日常管理的强大的工具，有了它，你可能就很容易做到：

.. i18n: * Continue the work started by a colleague if she has gone on vacation, and respond to her customers
.. i18n:   if needed,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * Get hold of examples of all document types with just a few clicks, so that you can follow company
.. i18n:   standards in such areas as order confirmation, price requests, meeting minutes, customer
.. i18n:   deliverables, contract examples, and models for faxes and letters,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * Retrieve procedures and other associated documents if you do not know how to do a certain task –
.. i18n:   such as things you should do when hiring a new employee, organizing a conference, or
.. i18n:   structuring meeting minutes,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * Reuse work done by a colleague to meet similar needs and build on all the individual
.. i18n:   work done in your own company,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * Find all the orders for a customer or from a supplier in just a few seconds to answer questions or
.. i18n:   to continue a discussion when the initial contact point in your company is not available,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * Build on your working methods and enable your colleagues to benefit from each improvement in a
.. i18n:   document type or a procedure.
..

* 如果同事去了度假，你也可以继续她的工作，有需要还可以回复她的客户,

* 只需点击几下获取所有文件类型的样板。因此当你制作询价单,
  会议纪要，客户交付单，合同，传真和信件的样板可以按照公司的标准，

* 在招聘新员工、组织会议或者整理会议纪要时，如果你不知道相关的文档结构，
  你可以通过系统检索相关文件，

* 在面对类似的需求的时候复用同事的记录，并在公司建立你的个人工作档案,

* 几秒钟内就可以找到客户或者供应商在公司的所有订单并回答他们的问题，如果是没有初次记录
  也可以通过继续沟通在系统里建立初次接触的记录,

* 通过建立你的工作方法让你的同事从文件和流程的改良中获益。

.. i18n: From these examples you can see the importance of a good document management system, and what it
.. i18n: might contribute to the improvement of productivity and the quality of the output from each
.. i18n: employee.
..

从这些例子你看可以看出一个良好的文档管理系统的重要性，它有助于提高每个员工的工作效率和质量。
