Dashboards
==========

Dashboards provide an overview of all the information important to you
on a single page. The menu gives you access to predefined boards for
Accounting, Production and Project Management.

Unlike most other ERP systems and classic statistically-based systems, OpenERP
can provide dashboards to all users, not just to
directors and accountants.
