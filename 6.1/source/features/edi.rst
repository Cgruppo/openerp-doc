===

The Open Object framework provides many tools which help synchronise your
databases or import new data into OpenERP. Tools dedicated to some software
(ecommerce, crm, etc.) are also provided. The EDI module allows you to synchronise
orders and deliveries with your suppliers and customers.

It is used to synchronise OpenERP with SAP in distribution and food industry
companies.
