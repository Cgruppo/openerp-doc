Expenses
========

This module allows you to manage your company's daily expenses. It gives you
access to your employees' notes fees and access to complete,
validate or refuse the notes of a period. After validation it creates
an invoice for the employee.

Employee can encode their own expenses and the validation flow puts it
automatically in the accounting after management validation.
