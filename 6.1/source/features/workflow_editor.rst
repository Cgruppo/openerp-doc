===============

As part of the integrated Business Process Management engine of OpenERP, the
workflow editor allows you to adapt the logic of all document processing to
your enterprise's needs. The flexibility of this system will allow your software
to evolve with your company's needs on a daily basis.

You can trigger actions on any activity of the workflow: sending email/SMS, printing
reports, computing values or modifying objects, trigger other workflows, call
external services, etc.
