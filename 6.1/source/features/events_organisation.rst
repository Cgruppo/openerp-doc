Events Organisation
===================

The event module allows you efficiently organise events and related tasks:
planning, registration tracking, invoicing, attendances, getting the
payments, etc.  It is completely integrated with the CRM and accounting
modules. You can also use the mail gateway to get information requests or
registrations directly by email.
