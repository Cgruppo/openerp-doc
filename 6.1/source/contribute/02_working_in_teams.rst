Official committers are people allowed to commit in the shared community repositories.
Those people are approved as committers by the community once they've provided
enough good-quality patches and/or contributions in the project.

They are allowed to :

  * Propose and post their own patches against bug reports.
  * Review patches from contributors, comments and / or improve them.
  * Commit good-quality patch or contribution in the community repository.
  * Write a news on the Planet OpenERP RSS

The community contributors team list include the following teams, most

After contributing on a specific team's project, you can apply to be part of the related team and the members of that team will vote on your approval.

As part of all of all other " * Core Editors" teams, we have the "**OpenERP Community Reviewer**" team : https://launchpad.net/~openerp-community-reviewer

The goal is to have a basis of strong community members in all specific teams. This is a team of well experienced OpenERP developers that can have a word on any community developments. Their role is to help having good quality, well maintained modules. They have a mailing list here: openerp-community-reviewer@lists.launchpad.net 

Historically there was the generic `OpenERP committers <https://launchpad.net/~openerp-commiter>`_
team, but it has become deprecated along with the phase out of the obsolete
extra-addons shared repository.

The OpenERP core team are the employees from OpenERP SA responsible for the
quality of the Official repository. They assure the stability and coherence
of the official version by reviewing all patches and commits.

The OpenERP Core Team is available on Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/~openerp


Expert Teams
""""""""""""

To help developers and contributors make the right decisions when
improving OpenERP, we set up expert teams for different management domains.
Only people that have a strong experience in OpenERP and the related domain can
apply as an expert. We have teams of accountants, manufacturing experts,
technical experts, services management experts, ...

Developers can contact our experts mailing list when they need feedback on
particular features to be developed. Please contact our experts only for new
development related questions. They don't provide help on current features of
OpenERP. Most of our experts have very senior positions in the company they work
for, so they don't have time to spend providing help or support.

The expert teams are:

  * Accounting: https://launchpad.net/~openerp-expert-accounting
  * Services Management: https://launchpad.net/~openerp-expert-service
  * Manufacturing Industries: https://launchpad.net/~openerp-expert-production
  * Framework: https://launchpad.net/~openerp-expert-framework
  * Usability: https://launchpad.net/~openerp-expert-ergonomy
  * Localization/Translations: https://launchpad.net/~openerp-expert-localization

Requesting Advice from a Team
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you `create a specification <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openobject/+addspec>`_ 
for a new feature on launchpad (called a blueprint), you can
assign an expert team as a drafter of the specification. Then, you can click
on request feedback on your blueprint and assign this to an expert team.

They will receive a notification email and will discuss the requested
feature. The team will improve your specifications directly in your blueprint.

Translators team
""""""""""""""""

.. index::
   single: translators team (teams)

The translation teams are in charge of the translation of OpenERP in a specific language.
The list of current translation teams can be found here: https://translations.launchpad.net/+groups/openobject-translators

For more information regarding OpenERP translations and the corresponding process,
please see the :ref:`translating_software` section.

Merge Proposal
""""""""""""""

Making a merge proposal of your own code is the way to integrate your work in the OpenERP project. You can request a merge proposal either on OpenERP's branch or OpenERP community's branch. In every project the process is the same and you can get the basic documentation here: https://help.launchpad.net/Code/Review
