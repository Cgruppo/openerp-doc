管理你的仓库来完成你的生产
#####################################################

.. i18n:  This part of the book concentrates on physical materials - the handling of stock and
.. i18n:  the transformation of materials by assembly and manufacture.
..

 书的这部分专注于原材料 - 库存处理以及经过组装或生产的转变。
 
.. i18n:  Stocks are the physical embodiment of their product specification, things rather than
.. i18n:  datasheets. So they need to be stored and moved between locations, and tracked in
.. i18n:  sets and individually. They have a size, a weight, and a cost.
.. i18n:  OpenERP manages all of this in some rather useful and unique ways.
..

 仓库是物理体现产品规格而不是数据表。因此他们需要存储或位置移动，需要跟踪记录他们全部和单个的. 
他们的尺寸, 重量, 和价格. OpenERP 通过比较有用的独特方式来管理所有这一切。

.. i18n:  Manufacturing is the transformation of materials and components, perhaps using measurable
.. i18n:  resources, into other products and services, adding value to your company on the way.
..

 生产是材料的改造和组装, 利用有效资源，统筹到产品或服务中 , 增加公司成长的附加值.
