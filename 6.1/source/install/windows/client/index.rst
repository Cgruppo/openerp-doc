OpenERP Client Installation
===========================

The native GTK client is available as a legacy interface for users who still require it, but the recommended way to access OpenERP 6.1 is the built-in web interface.

You must install, configure and run the OpenERP Server before using the
OpenERP Client. The client needs the server to run. You can install the server
application on your computer, or on an independent server accessible by
network.

Downloading the OpenERP Client
------------------------------

The OpenERP Client can be downloaded from
`OpenERP website's download page <http://www.openerp.com/downloads>`_.

Under `Windows Auto-Installer`, choose **Client** to download the OpenERP Client standalone.

Installing the OpenERP Client
-----------------------------

Click the executable installation file you have just downloaded, and proceed with the following steps:

* 1. Select installation language
	The default is ``English``. The other option is ``French``.

* 2. Welcome message
	Carefully follow the recommendations given in this step.

* 3. Licence Agreement
	It is important that you accept the GNU General Public License to proceed with installation.

* 4. Select folder for installation
	By default, OpenERP Client is installed in ``C:\Program Files\OpenERP 6.0\Client``. To install in a different folder, browse for a different location(folder) in this step.

* 5. Create shortcuts
	Select a folder in the `Start` menu where you would like to create the program's shortcuts.

Starting the OpenERP Client
---------------------------

The installation program creates shortcuts in the main program menu and on the desktop, which you can use to start the client.
Be sure to have an OpenERP Server running somewhere (on your computer or a
distant server) to be able to use the client software.
