    * Two incremental backup servers,
    * An access to the control center, backup and monitoring system.

It also includes the following services:

    * Maintenance services
          1. Bug fixes analyzed within 3 working days

    * Maintenance and 24/7 monitoring of your servers

Pricing and Payments
--------------------

What is OpenERP's Pricing Model?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Our pricing model is simple. We charge $49 or €39 per user, per month. We bill each month according to the number of users registered at that time. If you add new users during the next 30 days they will only be charged with the next invoice.

The storage volume allowed is 1GB. If you use more we will charge $6.5 or €5 per extra GB.

What is the Payment Process?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You will receive an invoice at the beginning of each billing period, according to the number
of active users in the system. Once the invoice is paid, you will get a confirmation that payment
has been successful through the secured payment platform. If you do not pay the invoice within the
payment term, your account will be deactivated. It will however be reactivated automatically on payment.
We will keep your data for 2 months after an account is closed, unless explicitly requested otherwise by the customer.

How can I check my Monthly Usage and Invoice?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Daily statistics on your OpenERP Online usage page are available from the control center.
Statistics include hours of use by instance, hours of use by day or user, monthly invoice amount, space used by
server, etc.

Infrastructure and Security
---------------------------

What is the Infrastructure Provided?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For every OpenERP Online subscription, we provide access to the following infrastructure to
guarantee you maximum reliability and security:

    * OpenERP Server and Web Interface
    * PostgreSQL database
    * Backup servers
    * Access to the control center, so that you can control your OpenERP Online instances and perform actions: create new instances, migrations, duplicate instances, access to backups, etc.

Where are the Data Centers Located?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We have two data centers, one in Europe (France) and one in the U.S. (East Coast).

Can I get my Data back?
+++++++++++++++++++++++

With OpenERP Online, we want to provide you with the maximum flexibility and avoid the traditional
Lock-In model of SaaS offers. Therefore, the version of OpenERP used in OpenERP Online is the same as
the Open Source version of OpenERP you can install on your premises.

From the control center, you have access to all your backup servers. You can download a
dump of your PostgreSQL database and all your files from our FTP access and switch to an on-site
installation of OpenERP.

Can I get a Shell Access to my Servers?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For security and confidentiality reasons, we do not provide servers' shell access to our customers.
We only allow 3 OpenERP employees to have a root access to our customers' servers.

Data Import
-----------

I already use OpenERP, can I Migrate to the OpenERP Online Offer?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Yes, this is possible if your instance uses only modules from the latest official (certified) addons. Contact our
sales team to get a quotation: online@openerp.com.

Can I Import Data from other Software applications in my OpenERP Online System?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

OpenERP supports data importation from .CSV text files (Comma Separated Values) for any object in the
system. If you can export all your data to .CSV files, you should be able to import it in OpenERP.
For experts, you can also connect your own scripts through web-services. Read our documentation for more
information. We also provide data migration services. Contact us to get a quotation depending on your current
software: online@openerp.com.

Solutions

What should I do if I have Specific Needs?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

directly in the OpenERP user interface. We provide you with the report designer, the screen and object
editor, a workflow designer, etc. Should you want to develop new modules, we advise you to use the on-site
edition and have your modules certified by OpenERP to guarantee that they will be supported by
OpenERP in the long term.
