the best results:

.. i18n:     #. Make a fresh backup of all existing databases, as well as a backup of the files 
.. i18n:        of your OpenERP installation (server and addons), just in case.
.. i18n:     #. Locate the executable file to start the Server, it should be named
.. i18n:        ``openerp-server.py``. You may want to have a look at the running processes
.. i18n:        to find out the command-line parameters that are passed to the server (needed below).
.. i18n:     #. Stop the OpenERP server.
.. i18n:     #. Update the source files to the latest release, or simply install the new releases
.. i18n:        over the previous ones.
.. i18n:     #. Start the server manually (directly call the executable you located above), with
.. i18n:        the following additional parameters, to trigger an update of all module data and
.. i18n:        views in the database, based on the new source files (include your usual startup
.. i18n:        parameters, if any, and replace ``DB_NAME`` with the name of the OpenERP database you wish
.. i18n:        to update)::

.. i18n:        ``OpenERP server is running, waiting for connections`` or wait until you can connect
.. i18n:        to that database with a GTK client), then stop the server with :kbd:`Ctrl+C` and repeat the
.. i18n:        previous step for each database on this OpenERP installation (any database not updated
.. i18n:        will use the latest business logic but might have errors or missing improvements in
.. i18n:        the views until you update it using this procedure).
.. i18n:     #. Stop the server again with :kbd:`Ctrl+C` and restart it normally (no extra parameters anymore).

.. i18n: .. note:: Server
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:         As an alternative to restarting the server in update mode for each database, as described above, you may try to start the server normally, and then connect to each database as the *Administrator* user, open the list of modules and manually trigger an update of the *base* module. Because all modules depend on *base* they will be updated too. However this requires the *Administrator* password of each database and may not work for some updates, specifically when the update prevents you from logging into the system.

Going to a Newer Major Release
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. i18n: The frequency of major stable releases has fluctuated in the past, but the current policy is to release a new stable version every 6 months on average, with one out of three stable versions being a Long Term Support (LTS) version. An LTS version is a normal stable version, but one that is supported for an extended time under the OpenERP Publisherâ€™s Warranty (OPW). Stable versions are labelled as a decimal number with 2 components (e.g. 6.1), where the leftmost part indicates the corresponding Long Term Support (LTS) version, and the second digit indicates successive stable releases between two LTS versions.

Transitioning to the next major release implies a lot more changes than jumping to another minor release.
As the underlying OpenERP data structures usually evolve quite a bit from one major release to the next, a full migration of the existing data is needed.
Each major release will be published with specific recommendations and procedures for upgrading an existing OpenERP system to the next major version.
