Description
-----------

::

  A complete solution for those companies who use discounts and/or 
      product prices with tax included extensively.
      
      This module is like product_visible_discount but improved in many ways:
        -Properly calculates discounts for any price type, not only list_price.
        -It's able to add/subtract tax from the price before calculating the discount.
        This means you can have for example a 'shop price' calculated with tax included
        and define a price list like 'shop price net -5%' easily.
        -It works with product_price_update that module can mass calculate and 
        update product prices with tax included.
        -A simpler override of the SO's product_id_change, 2 browses and 2 reads less.
        -Purchase Orders can also use discounts if the supplier defines his prices
        with discounts.
        -Even PO's generated with MRP will have the discounts defined in the 
        supplier price list.
      
      Compatibility: tested with OpenERP v5.0
