Cube Browser
============

Cube Browser of Open Object-BI Platform lets users design their own reports through a clean and effective Web-based environment. 

It provides users with a friendly layer to create MDX Query on previously designed OLAP Cubes with a few mouse clicks, and retrieve the desired information in a comprehensible tabular layout. They can reformat the layout, to drill to fetch further fine information and easily analyze it to understand business currents and causes. 

If users don't need the full power of query capabilities they can simply explore information in existing reportsâ€”formatting and interacting with data to meet their reporting needs.

Goal behind Cube Browser
------------------------

Provide user with a thin client to make reporting far more efficient. 
Let user use full power of MDXAlchemy engine. 
Wrapping the process of designing queries into simpler steps: clicks, drags and drops. 
Keeping the interface as simple yet powerful reporting tool.
