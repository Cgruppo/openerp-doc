.. i18n: By providing a flexible, platform-neutral method to render diverse data types, XML has become a standard for exchanging information across heterogeneous applications. Web services, a set of XML based protocols for finding and communicating between loosely-coupled, internet callable application "services" have therefore become the preferred mechanism for integrating heterogeneous applications and enabling service architectures.
