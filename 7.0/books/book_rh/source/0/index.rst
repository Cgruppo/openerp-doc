Information Systems have played an increasingly visible role over the past several years in
improving the competitiveness of business.
They are more than just tools for handling repetitive tasks; they will guide and advance
all of a company's daily activities. Integrated Management Software is today very often a
key source of significant competitive advantage.

Some may look at the Business Application market as a mature market dominated by a few large key players, with no new business opportunities. 

This would be ignoring the market reality. So many customers are frustrated by their experience with existing vendors; so many companies around the world need to have access to business applications, but cannot afford them.

OpenERP believes that business applications should not be a luxury. That any company, anywhere in the world, should be able to afford the best tools to professionally expand business.  That is one of the reasons why OpenERP needs to break the existing rules of the ERPs and the Business Applications market.

Customers should use their budget smartly and invest in customizing the application to their specific needs, rather than paying expensive license fees. OpenERP is committed to the Open Source Business Model precisely because Open Source allows for this. Open Source is a disruptive model, as it creates more value for the customers.

For decades, customers have developed applications which remained specific to their own needs, and in the end proved extremely expensive to maintain. Open Source means that customers can benefit from past developments of other companies. Also by contributing to the evolution of the software, the users will enjoy the guarantee that their development will be included in future versions of the software. One of the major advantages is that such a *Community* brings a wealth of new functionality.  

Open Source also allows us to engage with our customers differently. Since there is no licensing cost, any potential customer can download, test and use the software. OpenERP has no need for an expensive sales force to promote the product. OpenERP just needs to make the best product and make it available to customers.

Open Source allows for many barriers in this industry to be broken. The software is available to many companies who could otherwise not afford expensive business applications license fees. The OpenERP solution allows customers to use their money smartly and tailor the software to their individual needs. OpenERP leverages from its customer base to enrich the software and finally eradicate any lock-in to allow customers to use and even drop the software freely.

.. *

OpenERP can build a new breed of business applications, more modular, more customer-friendly, fully web-based, which others cannot due to the heritage of their legacy systems.

OpenERP is a comprehensive suite of business applications including Sales, CRM, Project management, Warehouse management, Manufacturing, Financial management, and Human Resources, just to name a few. More than 1000 OpenERP modules are available from the OpenERP Apps market place (http://apps.openerp.com/).

The key to continued sales success is effective Customer Relationship Management, and that is precisely the main topic of the book you are reading.
OpenERP's CRM and Sales features are flexible and highly developed to assist you in managing all aspects of partner relationships.

OpenERP can share information with the most common email clients, calendars and mobile phones, allowing your staff to build on previous productivity and experience by continuing to use familiar email and office systems, now connected to OpenERP. In a few clicks, your sales person can transfer necessary information to the OpenERP software. You can link important emails to the CRM directly from your current mailbox and even reply from your own mailbox and have the answer stored in your CRM automatically.

all based on Free / Open Source software.

He originated Tiny ERP, now OpenERP, and is the director of two companies including OpenERP S.A.,

employees without loans or external fund-raising, and while making a profit.

He has also developed several large scale projects, such as Auction-in-Europe.com,
which became the leader in the art market in Belgium.
Even today people sell more art works there than on ebay.be.

He is also the founder of the LUG (Linux User Group) of Louvain-la-Neuve,
and of several free projects like OpenReport, OpenStuff and Tiny Report.
Educated as a civil engineer (polytechnic), he has won several IT prizes in Europe such as Wired

Els Van Vossel always had a dedication to both written and spoken word.
Clear and explicit communication is crucial.

Educated as a Professional Translator in Antwerp, she worked as an independent translator
on the localization of major ERP software. Els acquired ERP knowledge and decided
to start working as a functional ERP consultant and a Technical Communicator for ERP software.

As such, the world of OpenSource software became more and more attractive.
She started working with OpenERP software in her free time and doing so, Els really wanted to
meet Fabien Pinckaers to share thoughts about documentation and training strategy.
At a Partner Meeting she heard Fabien was looking for someone to manage training & documentation.
This was absolutely an opportunity to be qualified, and now Els is the OpenERP Training Program Manager
and in this job responsible for the worldwide training and certification program of OpenERP.

Being an author of several Software Manuals, she finds it exciting to work on the
OpenERP documentation and continuously take it to a higher level. Please note that this is a hell of a job,
but Els finds great pleasure in doing it!
