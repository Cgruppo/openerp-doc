Until now only two main alternatives existed for systems managing all of a company's information:
install a proprietary ERP system, complete but usually overweight, inflexible, and expensive;
or develop a solution internally, adapted to current needs but often expensive to develop and to maintain, not
integrated, and incomplete.

With its free business model, OpenERP combines the advantages of a complete ERP system with the
flexibility of an in-house solution.
The open source code, the project's general flexibility, and its hundreds of modules
let you construct a solution from a selection of Business Applications, integrating the modules already available. To sustain your growth, you can freely update your OpenERP application to fit your ever changing needs.

The results will be at the top end of what you might expect from any ERP system,
let alone an Open Source system.
The considerable gains in productivity, efficiency and visibility become apparent only a few months
after implementation.
And you can gain from increased operational quality.
Because there are fewer repetitive tasks for your staff to do,
they can concentrate on higher added-value work.
We frequently receive the gratitude of senior management who get better results from their
business because they have adopted OpenERP.

Proprietary software vendors drive on average 25% of their revenues from Licenses. Instead, OpenERP revenues are services-based.

Our Open Source model allows us to maintain a lower cost structure thanks to:

    * An Efficient Development Model:  we leverage from the improvements in the software driven by our customers and community members. As a result more than 700 modules have been developed to date. The software is available in 22 languages and more than 1000 individuals contribute to OpenERP,

    * A Volume-based Sales Model: the software can be downloaded for free. Thousands of customers from over 50 countries test it every month and when the time is right for them, they choose to implement our solution. This allows us to reduce very significantly our sales and marketing costs compared to other vendors,

    * A single platform for both on line and on site: OpenERP has been designed from the start to be used either on line or on site. This is not the case for most vendors, who need to carry their legacy software and cannot leverage from the web.

The absence of license revenues is more than offset by the benefits driven from the Open Source model.

Many resources are at hand to accompany you on your OpenERP adventure. The software can be downloaded for free, but we will never claim that deploying an ERP can be done for free. It requires services from OpenERP and its partners.

Larger companies often prefer a more classic implementation path. Even though OpenERP's ease-of-use
makes this task easier than with other systems, you cannot hide the fact that a project
implementation is complex and introduces big changes to a company.

So you can turn towards some of the different actors in this free software ecosystem to help you
out:

* the community of users and developers,

* OpenERP's partners,

* the main project developers, OpenERP, themselves.

    \subsection*{The Community of Users and Developers}
    \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The Community of Users and Developers}

.. *

The community, supported by OpenERP, hosts a set of communication tools which can help you to discover the OpenERP software.

* **The forum**: http://www.openerp.com/forum/

The forum enables you to discuss issues with other OpenERP users. It is very active and your contributions are very welcome.

* **Online Documentation**: http://doc.openerp.com

This documentation includes various topics: how to use OpenERP, how to
develop on OpenERP, how to install OpenERP and much more.

* **OpenERP Apps**: http://apps.openerp.com/

A list of available modules and their descriptions.

* **Launchpad** : https://code.launchpad.net/~openobject/

The most recent communication tool is the launchpad system, which now hosts all of OpenERP's
source code (using the *bzr* source code control system) and is used for reporting bugs. It has
become the central location for OpenERP technology.

If you need contractual guarantees for implementing and maintaining OpenERP, you can contact an
official OpenERP partner. OpenERP partners offer various services such as user training,
prototype installations, and change management services. The complete list of partners by country
and by type can be found on the official OpenERP site: http://www.openerp.com/partners.

    \subsection*{The Main Developer, OpenERP}
    \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The Main Developer, OpenERP}

Finally you can call the main project developers, OpenERP, who can help you in your OpenERP project.
OpenERP offers various services such as free demonstration days for the software, user training and
technical training, support contracts, maintenance contracts. Depending
on the demand, OpenERP can also put you in contact with partners most in line with your requirements.

Do not forget that OpenERP has more than seven hundred modules available and that only some business applications are covered in this book. So if you have not found a answer to your questions here, please
check http://apps.openerp.com/, talk to other OpenERP users on the forum, and certainly do not hesitate to
contact a partner.


Wishing you the greatest of success in your ERP project,
