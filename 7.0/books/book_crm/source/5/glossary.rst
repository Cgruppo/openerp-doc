An overview of the Basic Concepts
---------------------------------

Leads
  A lead is a first, unqualified contact with a new prospect. Use leads when you import a database of prospects or integrate your website's contact form with OpenERP.
  Once qualified, the lead can be converted to a partner and a business opportunity for further detailed tracking of related activities.

Opportunities
  Opportunities allow you to track the pipeline of your best deals: history of the communication, expected revenues, stage of each opportunity, expected closings, etc. Opportunities
  are usually connected with the email gateway which allows you to keep the history of the emails exchanged with the customer. Your teams will be able to schedule meetings and phone
  calls on opportunities, to convert opportunities into quotations, to manage documents related to the opportunity and to track all activities related to this customer.

Sales Orders
  The sales order manages invoicing, product fulfilment and delivery processes. OpenERP can handle products, services and consumables. A sales order can trigger tasks, manufacturing
  orders, purchases, etc. It supports several invoicing methods according to your configuration: from the sales order, the delivery, etc.

Address Book
  The Customer Address book manages your list of customers. The customer form allows you to record details about your customers (address, contacts, pricelist, account, etc.).
  With the `History` tab, you can follow all moves and transactions related to a customer, such as leads & opportunities, meetings, phone calls and much more.

Meetings
  The Meeting Calendar is shared between sales teams and is fully integrated with the other applications like employee holidays. You can also synchronise meetings with your mobile
  phone or other calendar software using the CalDAV interface.

Phone Calls
  Easily trace all your Inbound calls. The Inbound menu opens a search view in editable mode, so that you can easily modify or add a new call record. With the action buttons in form
  view, you can convert a phone call into an opportunity or plan a meeting.
  The Outbound menu opens a search view in editable mode, so that you can easily modify or plan a new call. Action buttons allow you to  make your call status evolve for a better
  follow up of your planned calls. During calls, convert your lead into an opportunity, plan a meeting or cancel it.

Billing
  Lines to invoice opens a search view with sales order lines and their status. You can use this menu to create invoices from sales order lines that are already delivered, but not
  invoiced yet.

AfterSales Services
  Record and trace your customers' claims here. A claim is defined by a customer's name, several types, status and a priority level. A claim can also be a preventive or repairing
  action. A claim can be linked to a reference like a sales order, or a product lot number. You can send emails with attachments directly from OpenERP and get the history of the
  claim treatment (emails sent, interventions type, etc.).
  Like recording and processing claims, Helpdesk and Support are good tools to trace your interventions. This menu is more adapted to oral communication, which is not necessarily
  related to a claim. Select a customer, add notes and categorize your interventions with a channel and a priority level.

Fund Raising
  When you wish to support your organization or a campaign, you can trace all your activities for collecting money. The menu opens a search list where you can find fund descriptions,
  email, history and probability of success. Several action buttons allow you to easily modify your different fund statuses.

Products
  Product category opens a tree structure view of your products by category. In OpenERP, a product is something you can buy and sell. It can be a raw material, a stockable product,
  a consumable or a service. The product form contains detailed information, such as procurement logistics, sales price, product category, suppliers, etc.

Documents
  Documents give you access to all attached documents; it's a repository of all attached documents (emails, documents attached to a project, etc.)

Sales FAQ
  The Frequently Asked Sales Questions is a wiki page used to share frequently asked questions.

*Reporting & Dashboards*

Get an analysis of ``Phone Call`` numbers and delay to close, stage, user suits to different groups for a global or a more detailed analysis.

``Helpdesk`` allows you to consult different information relative to support demands. Check for processing delays, number of responses given and emails sent as well as costs. You can sort your analysis by different groups to get a blow-by-blow analysis.

With ``Fund Raising``, at a glance, get a view to your fund raising campaigns with the estimated revenues, average probability and delay to close.

How to Use Filters?
-------------------

The `Advanced Search View` is a new feature of OpenERP v6 which provides a very user-friendly filtering mechanism
for the end-user to easily look up desired records from the list.

The perfect example of an advanced search view is a Statistical Report of OpenERP.
Such a report shows the statistical summary with filtered results to the end-user.

Usually, an Advanced Search is composed of three elements, the `Filter` buttons at the top, the `Extended Filters`, and the `Group by` option.
These filters are dynamic, so according to filters you apply, extra columns may be added to the view.

You can also easily combine filters; an arrow will be displayed and you will get a structure according to the order in which you clicked the `Filter` buttons.

.. tip:: Filters

       Simply by changing the order in which you select your buttons, you will get a completely different filtered view. E.g. select Salesman first, then Customer or vice versa.
