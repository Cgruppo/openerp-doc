Webmail
=======

Open Object integrates a full featured webmail. It allows people to work, manage
and read email through a single interface containing all services of the company.
It's a fully integrated system, with a drag and drop interface and full use of Ajax
for speed.

This is the very first extensible webmail system ever made. With the Open Object
view designer, you can customize every interface to fullfil your specific needs
and improve your productivity.
