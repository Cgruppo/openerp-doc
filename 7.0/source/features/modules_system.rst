Module System
=============

OpenERP (and the Open Object framework) is probably the most advanced and
flexible framework in the world. All features of OpenERP are packaged as
independent modules, allowing you to install only what you need.
They are able to work independently and, if installed together, they integrate
perfectly to automate all tasks and avoid duplication of data.

You can generate your own modules without custom coding, using
our customization tools: workflow editor, object editor, view designer,
report designer, BI reports, customizable actions, etc. All customisations
made on the server can be saved as a module to easily deploy, redistribute and
share.
