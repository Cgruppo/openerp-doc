OpenERP Web Installation
========================

As of OpenERP 6.1, the web client is included as part of the standard
all-in-one installation, so no extra step is required to install it.

The all-in-one version may be downloaded from the `OpenERP website's download page <http://www.openerp.com/downloads>`_


Running the OpenERP Web Client
------------------------------

The OpenERP 6.1 web client is automatically available as soon as the
OpenERP server is running. You can access it by connecting with your
favorite web browser to the address and port of your OpenERP server,
by default ``http://localhost:8069``.
 

Supported Browsers
------------------

The OpenERP Web Client is known to work best with the latest version of Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.
The following browsers are supported: 

 #. Google Chrome 9.0 or later
 #. Firefox 4.0 or later
 #. Safari 4.1 or later
 #. Opera 10.0 or later
 #. Internet Explorer 8.0 or later (later is strongly recommended)
 
.. note:: Contrary to OpenERP 6.0, no flash plugin is required to access the OpenERP 6.1 web interface
