Installation
============

.. index:: Installation

This chapter contains the general installation procedure for deploying OpenERP on the main supported platforms.

For **OpenERP Online (SaaS mode)** the installation is as simple as creating a new account on https://www.openerp.com/online.
The first section in this chapter provides the answer to Frequently Asked Questions for SaaS usage.

For **OpenERP on-site**, the installation mainly consists of installing PostgreSQL (the database engine used by OpenERP), 
Python (built-in on most platforms) and then installing OpenERP itself, as an all-in-one package.

.. note:: For those familiar with earlier OpenERP versions, the 6.1 series has a different architecture, and only requires the installation of a single OpenERP package.
