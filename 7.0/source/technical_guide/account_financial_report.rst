Description

  Add some common financial/accounting reports and some wizards to quickly compute them:

    * Invoice list
    * Account move (journal ledger)
    * Account move line
    * Account balance compared period-fiscal year
    * Cumulative general ledger
  
  They can be found in the "Financial Management/Legal Statements/Generic Reports" menu or in the tree/form views of accounts, journals, invoices, account entries and account move lines.
  
  Some reports are based on previous work by Pexego and others on the c2c_finance_report module for TinyERP 4.2 by Camptocamp SA.
