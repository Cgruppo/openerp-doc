Description
-----------

::

  This module offers a growing collection of objects to create simple and advanced reports.
  	               You can create powerful reports with a few lines of python code and nothing else. (no sxw, rml or xml)
  				   This module follow multiple goals: 
  				     - To accelerate report creation by creating reusable pieces of code (one line of code to create standard header and footer)
  				     - To accelerate report generation (processing) by removing unnecessary parsing and transformations (direct python to pdf generation) 
  				     - To improve reporting capabilities by getting rid of incomplete parsers and limited middle technologies 
  				     - To make reports designs more uniform 
  				   
  				   For examples please see c2c_planning_management (our first module based on this tool).
