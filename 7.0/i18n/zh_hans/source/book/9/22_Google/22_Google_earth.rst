.. i18n: 
.. i18n:     KML is a file format used to display geographic data in an Earth browser such as Google Earth, Google Maps and Google Maps for mobile. KML uses a tag-based structure with nested elements and attributes and is based on the XML standard. All tags are case-sensitive and must appear exactly as they are listed in the KML Reference. The Reference indicates which tags are optional. Within a given element, tags must appear in the order shown in the Reference.
